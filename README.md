Flame-igo:
=========

Flamigo, not to be confused with Flamingo, is an open source game based on the Chilli X Driect X Framework. 
This project is partially developed with help from other users based on the http://www.planetchili.com forums.

The game revolves around a few players in an open map, all with flamethrowers or knives, in a deathmatch style game.
Last player standing, wins :)
This player will then have a slight advantage over other players when the world resets. The reward is yet to be determined.

A variety of maps are planned as well as the integration of a custom MP3 player, should the player wish to listen to his/her own selection of music.
A MDK (Map Development Kit) will be provided once the project looks promising.

A campaign is planned at this stage and will be elaborated on as development reaches this point.
An online multiplayer will be provided to deluxe edition contributors. (A donor.)

Peripheral support will strictly on be limited to the Keyboard and Mouse that Direct X provides.
This may receive some more attention if enough users provide us with the necessary documentation, evidence and donations.


The main objective of this game is to end up with a 32 player networking environment. This includes the use of a client and a server as different programs. The goal is to have a server, client and up to 32 players simultaneously playing this game.

For the author/s this game is a work in progress and is created in an open environment so long as the source code from which other games derived from this one, is also made freely available.
The author/s of this game have used it's creation as an educational experience. Please keep this in mind once development starts to slow down.
